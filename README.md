# Welcome!

My name is Jonathan and I'm a software engineer.
I enjoy solving problems, all kinds of strategy games, and doing sports.
One day I'll have a very nice website to show you maybe, but for now you can contact me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-mary/) or jon85ma@gmail.com.

I'm fluent in JS (React/Node.js) and Python.
